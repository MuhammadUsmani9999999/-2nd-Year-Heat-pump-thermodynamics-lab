# Heat Pump Performance Analysis & Carnot Cycle Comparison

## Project Overview
This repository contains the lab report and supporting materials for an experiment conducted as part of the "Thermodynamics for Aerospace" module at the University of Hertfordshire. The project focuses on the operational efficiency of a heat pump system (TQ heat pump EC1500V) under varying thermal loads.

The core of this investigation involved assessing the heat pump's performance characteristics and comparing these experimental results against theoretical predictions derived from the idealised reversed Carnot cycle.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this lab experiment were to:
1.  Demonstrate and conduct a performance analysis of a heat pump cycle.
2.  Evaluate the performance of the heat pump cycle under different heat source and heat sink temperatures.
3.  Perform a comparative analysis between the actual heat pump cycle performance and the theoretical reversed Carnot cycle.

## Methodology
The experiment involved:
*   Operating the TQ heat pump (EC1500V) under various conditions (water pump "ON" and "OFF" at different hot water tank temperatures: 30°C, 35°C, 40°C).
*   Collecting experimental data, including temperatures and pressures at key points in the refrigerant cycle (compressor suction/discharge, expansion valve inlet/outlet).
*   Utilizing a pressure-enthalpy (P-h) chart for refrigerant R-134a to determine enthalpy values at different state points.
*   Calculating key performance metrics:
    *   Actual work of compression.
    *   Refrigerating and Heating effects.
    *   Actual Coefficient of Performance (COPh).
    *   Theoretical Coefficient of Performance for the reversed Carnot cycle (COPh_carnot).
*   Analyzing trends and discrepancies between the actual and ideal cycle performance.
