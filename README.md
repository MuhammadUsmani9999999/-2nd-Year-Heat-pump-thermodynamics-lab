# -2nd-Year-Heat-pump-thermodynamics-lab
Lab report for Thermodynamics for Aerospace (Uni of Herts). Analysis of heat pump system efficiency under varying thermal loads. Compares experimental performance (pressure-enthalpy charts) with theoretical reversed Carnot cycle predictions.
Okay, this "Heat Pump Lab Report" for your "Thermodynamics for Aerospace" module is another good piece of practical, analytical work to showcase. It demonstrates your understanding of thermodynamic principles, experimental procedures, data analysis, and technical reporting.

Here's how you can create a GitHub repository for this project:

**Repository Name Suggestions:**

*   `heat-pump-thermodynamics-lab`
*   `aerospace-thermo-heat-pump-analysis`
*   `uoh-thermodynamics-heat-pump-report` (Uni of Herts)
*   `heat-pump-performance-carnot-comparison`
**Project Title:** e.g., "Heat Pump Performance Analysis & Carnot Cycle Comparison"
  **Module Context:** Briefly mention it's for your "Thermodynamics for Aerospace" module at the University of Hertfordshire.
    **Project Aim/Objectives:**
        *   Demonstration and performance analysis of a heat pump cycle.
        *   Evaluation of heat pump cycle performance under different heat source/sink temperatures.
        *   Performance comparison between the actual heat pump cycle and the idealised reversed Carnot cycle.
       **Methodology Briefly Described:**
        *   Experimental setup (TQ heat pump EC1500V).
        *   Data collection (temperatures, pressures at various points in the cycle).
        *   Theoretical calculations (Carnot COP, actual COP, heating/refrigerating effect, work of compression).
        *   Analysis using pressure-enthalpy (P-h) charts for R-134a.
       **Key Concepts/Skills Demonstrated:**
        *   Understanding of thermodynamic cycles (heat pump, reversed Carnot).
        *   Experimental data acquisition and analysis.
        *   Use of thermodynamic property charts (P-h diagram for R-134a).
        *   Calculation of Coefficient of Performance (COP).
        *   Comparison of real vs. ideal thermodynamic cycles.
        *   Technical report writing.
       **Software/Tools Used (if any beyond standard lab equipment):** Mention if you used Excel for calculations/plotting, or any specific software for generating the P-h charts if not done by hand.
       **Structure of the Repository:** (e.g., "Contains the final lab report and any supporting data/calculations.")
